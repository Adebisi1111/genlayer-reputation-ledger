# Agent reputation is a reusable primitive for the agentic economy:
# after a job (or a dispute resolution) an agent's outcome is recorded,
# but the claimed outcome is NOT trusted blindly. Instead the contract
# fetches real evidence and asks an LLM to verify the claim, running that
# judgment through GenLayer's equivalence principle (gl.vm.run_nondet) so
# leader and validators must agree. Only verified outcomes move the score.
#
# State is modeled with GenLayer-native TreeMap + u256. The consensus check
# (nondet web fetch + LLM verdict + equivalence) is the genuine GenLayer
# logic that makes this a real primitive, not simple storage.
